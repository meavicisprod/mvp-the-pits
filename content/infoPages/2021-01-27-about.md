**Mea Vicis Productions** (or MVP) is a collective of artists who practice different forms, united by the love of skateboarding. While some of us have previously collaborated under different collectives, MVP has come together to produce the three-part "[(It's) the Pits](/about-the-pits)" project this upcoming summer.

As we are all skaters or interested by skate culture, in addition to being artists and/or locals of [Christie Pits Skatepark](https://www.instagram.com/cpskateboardpark/?hl=en), it was with great intention that we came together to execute this particular project.

Our diverse skills and connections across theatre, filmmaking, producing and writing have allowed us to gain verbal support and momentum from across the skate community's spectrum. Individuals, not-for-profit organizations and private businesses have all expressed their interest in our collective's works.
