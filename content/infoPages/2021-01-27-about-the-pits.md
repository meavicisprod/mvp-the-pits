> **(It's) the Pits** is a a 3-part project that invites local artists to guide participants in developing the agency to confidently partake in both skateboarding and in creative/tactical place-making through space reclamation, acting and sculpture art.

>The project also seeks to foster dialogue with the general public by inviting them as exhibit spectators.

## Background Info

The DIY [Christie Pits Skatepark](https://www.instagram.com/cpskateboardpark/?hl=en) in downtown Toronto was a particularly well-loved summer staple for skaters from across the GTA, but especially for those who live between Etobicoke and East York.

While this may seem like a large geographic spread, the lack of skateparks in Toronto is a known problem - hence the DIY nature of Christie Pits. Recently, however, this tradition has been brought to a halt due to conflict with a small number of local residents whose homes abut the park.

This has resulted in a huge ripple in the community, creating a glaring vacuum in the middle of one of the biggest cities in North America. (Two other Toronto skateparks will also be unavailable for the upcoming season due to construction, while another DIY space, Arizona, was also recently torn down.)

"(It's) the Pits" was born straight out of the ashes of this loss.

## Goals
The project will be led by a coalition of MVP members and partner artists/community supporters, who will work with participants from the Toronto skate community to execute the following three goals:

1. Through reclaiming the Sid Smith ice rink, demonstrate the intensity of the Toronto skate community’s love/need of the former Christie Pits Skatepark;

2. Guide participants in learning about Collective Creation, improv and acting, teaching the art of crafting narratives rather than to passively accept (typically) negative accounts of what it means to be a skater and/or an artist. MVP will work with the actors to create a short film as a testament to their new skills and as a permanent homage to Christie;

3. Invite non-skaters to participate in a dialogue about the importance of skate culture within the urban landscape by publicly displaying interactive co-created skate sculptures. The co-construction process will convey the skate community’s diverse range of artistic sensibilities, but its united grief over the loss of Christie Pits Skatepark.
