We're excited to announce that we're slowly but steadily gaining traction on the Installation component of ["(It's) the Pits"](/about-the-pits)! 

A few artists from the local community who will be collaborating with us include: 

Devan Predas

Josh Singal

Stay tuned to learn more about how we'll be working with this awesome team to help lead the community in both sending a message to the public and in creating the skatepark of our dreams!
