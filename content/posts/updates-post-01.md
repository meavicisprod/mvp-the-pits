MVP is currently working on a grant application to potentially secure up to $8000 in funding for the upcoming "(It's) the Pits" project.

We will be applying for a second grant towards the end of February and are awaiting the results of a third grant at this time of writing.

In the event that grants are not secured, we will be putting a contingency plan into place in order to execute as much of our three-part plan as possible.

We will likely have a more solid idea of our state of funding sometime around April.
